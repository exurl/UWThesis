\section{Problem Statement} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This thesis demonstrates the synthesis of a physics-based state-space model of MARGE. Unlike models from black-box system identification, physics-based ``grey-box'' models are capable of generalizing to conditions outside of those from which they were derived.

\section{Organization} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The remainer of this thesis is organized as follows: first, the test article used in this study is described in Chapter \ref{ch:sysDescription}. Then, the modeling methods used to generate the state-space model are formulated in Chapter \ref{ch:sysModeling}. The finite-element model and the GVT done to correct it are covered in Chapters \ref{ch:nastran} and \ref{ch:gvt}, respectively. The wind tunnel testing and model tuning performed based on it are covered in Chapters \ref{ch:windTunnel} and \ref{ch:tuning}, respectively. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes with a discussion of the results and potential follow-on studies.
