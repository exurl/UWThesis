\section{Problem Statement} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The goal of this project was to obtain a state-space model of MARGE in order to enable low-cost active aeroservoelastic control.

goal: best you can get without black-box sysID like CIFER

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The remainer of this thesis is organized as follows: first, the test article used in this study is described in Chapter \ref{ch:sysDescription}. Then, the modeling methods used to generate the state-space model are formulated in Chapter \ref{ch:sysModeling}. The finite-element modeling and GVT of MARGE are covered in Chapters \ref{ch:nastran} and \ref{ch:gvt}. The wind tunnel testing and model tuning performed based on it are covered in Chapters \ref{ch:windTunnel} and \ref{ch:tuning}. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes with a discussion of the results and potential follow-on studies.
